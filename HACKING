                    Transparent Tor Proxy Virtual Machine


See the doc/ directory for design and implementation details and the LICENSE
file for rights and terms.

To build you will need a *nix environment and a Windows XP or later operating
system for Qemu and libraries.  Various build configuration options and other
basic features are not yet avilable; edit the Makefile to adjust manually.



NOTE: Some subversion repositories are accessed via SSL with keys that may need
to be accepted manually.  To confirm that you have authenticated the keys used
issue the following commands as the build user and approve the keys if needed:

    svn info https://svn.torproject.org/svn/torvm/trunk/
    # Fingerprint: 55:62:fe:1b:60:f9:35:fa:50:44:dd:33:ea:54:77:26:e4:da:5f:72

    svn info https://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/trunk/
    # Fingerprint: a1:0a:d8:2d:af:4e:67:92:18:a0:27:b6:9f:2b:e1:12:08:28:a0:b1

    svn info https://svn.vidalia-project.net/svn/vidalia/trunk/

Run 'make' to build the VM kernel image and Windows build ISO image.  Once the
Windows build is done a complete Tor virtual machine package should be zipped
up ready for distribution in the C:\Tor_VM folder.  You will need to have the
Windows Driver Development Kit installed for the WinPcap and TAP-Win32 driver
compilation.  You can download the DDK installer ISO at:

    http://download.microsoft.com/download/9/0/f/90f019ac-8243-48d3-91cf-81fc4093ecfd/1830_usa_ddk.iso



If you have trouble with the build process downloading the various sources
from mirrors and upstream repositories a current copy of all the kamikaze and
win32 archives is available as: http://peertech.org/files/torvmdlcache.tar

The extracted dl and wdl directories can be used in the build by passing their
location to the make command:

    make DLDIR=./dl WDLDIR=./wdl all



Some files and paths of interest:

./build/kamikaze/x86-uclibc-vm/bin/openwrt-x86-vmlinuz
> this is the Linux kernel and initramfs used in the VM.

./build/win32/w32build.iso
> this is the automated win32 build ISO for Qemu.  Once everything is built
> the Qemu program and libraries will be placed in C:\Tor_VM

./build/kamikaze/patches/
> this directory contains the patch set applied to the kamikaze distribution
> for Tor VM customizations.

./build/win32/files/
> this directory contains the scripts and files used in the Windows build and
> packaged Qemu Tor_VM folder.

./build/win32/patches/
> this directory contains the patches applied to Qemu for bridged ethernet
> support via WinPcap and modifications for the WinPcap and TAP-Win32 drivers
> to prevent collision with any existing installed packages.



Fully automated builds are supported with some minor modifications to both the
Linux build host and the win32 build VM.  There are three steps to this setup:

First, create a restricted user where the build targets will be copied to from
the win32 build VM OS.  You can use the /bin/rbash restricted shell or similar
utility to ensure that scp privileges and not much else are provided.  Create an
SSH identity key for this user and copy the private key where the build user can
access it.

Second, configure the win32 build VM OS with a Startup script that invokes the
install.bat script on the win32 build ISO image.  This image is assumed to be
mounted when the win32 build VM OS boots up.

Last, pass the requisite information to the build script so that the necessary
commands are invoked during build to launch the win32 build VM and have the
completed build files copied back out to the host.  For example:

    make DLDIR=/var/build/dl WDLDIR=/var/build/wdl  \
         W32AUTO_BUILD_CMD=/var/build/runbldvm.sh   \
         AUTO_SHUTDOWN=TRUE                         \
         BUILD_SCP_IDF=/var/build/build_id_rsa      \
         BUILD_SCP_USER=build                       \
         BUILD_SCP_HOST=192.168.1.2                 \
         BUILD_SCP_DIR=/home/build                  \
         all

When the build completes a Tor_VM_<timestamp> directory will be created in the
requested location.  The timestamp is an integer value representing the UNIX
epoch in seconds.
