Transparent Tor Proxy Virtual Machine


See the doc/ directory for design and implementation details and the LICENSE
file for rights and terms.

To build you will need a *nix environment and a Windows XP or later operating
system for Qemu and libraries. Various build configuration options and other
basic features are not yet avilable; edit the Makefile to adjust manually.

Run 'make' to build the VM kernel image and Windows build ISO image. Once the
Windows build is done a complete Tor virtual machine package should be zipped
up ready for distribution.


Some files of interest:

./build/kamikaze/x86-uclibc-vm/bin/openwrt-x86-vmlinuz
> this is the Linux kernel and initramfs used in the VM.

./build/iso/vm.iso
> this is a bootable ISO using the kernel above.

./build/win32/w32build.iso
> this is the automated win32 build ISO for Qemu.  Once everything is built
> the Qemu program and libraries will be placed in C:\Tor_VM
