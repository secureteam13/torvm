                    Transparent Tor Proxy Virtual Machine


See the doc/ directory for design and implementation details and the LICENSE
file for rights and terms.

To build you will need a *nix environment and a Windows XP or later operating
system for Qemu and libraries.  Various build configuration options and other
basic features are not yet avilable; edit the Makefile to adjust manually.


NOTE: Two subversion repositories are accessed via SSL with keys that may need
to be accepted manually.  To confirm that you have authenticated the keys used
issue the following commands and approve the keys if needed:

    svn info https://svn.torproject.org/svn/torvm/trunk
    # Fingerprint: 55:62:fe:1b:60:f9:35:fa:50:44:dd:33:ea:54:77:26:e4:da:5f:72

    svn info https://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/trunk/
    # Fingerprint: a1:0a:d8:2d:af:4e:67:92:18:a0:27:b6:9f:2b:e1:12:08:28:a0:b1


Run 'make' to build the VM kernel image and Windows build ISO image.  Once the
Windows build is done a complete Tor virtual machine package should be zipped
up ready for distribution in the C:\Tor_VM folder.


Some files and paths of interest:

./build/kamikaze/x86-uclibc-vm/bin/openwrt-x86-vmlinuz
> this is the Linux kernel and initramfs used in the VM.

./build/iso/vm.iso
> this is a bootable ISO using the kernel above.

./build/win32/w32build.iso
> this is the automated win32 build ISO for Qemu.  Once everything is built
> the Qemu program and libraries will be placed in C:\Tor_VM

./build/kamikaze/patches/
> this directory contains the patch set applied to the kamikaze distribution
> for Tor VM customizations.

./build/win32/files/
> this directory contains the scripts and files used in the Windows build and
> packaged Qemu Tor_VM folder.

./build/win32/patches/
> this directory contains the patches applied to Qemu for bridged ethernet
> support via WinPCAP.
