Transparent Tor Proxy Virtual Machine

See the doc/ directory for design and implementation details and the LICENSE
file for rights and terms.

To build you will need a *nix environment and a Windows XP or later operating
system for Qemu and libraries. Various build configuration options and other
basic features are not yet avilable; edit the Makefile to adjust manually.

Run 'make' to build the VM kernel image and Windows build ISO image. Once the
Windows build is done a complete Tor virtual machine package should be zipped
up ready for distribution.
