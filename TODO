_______________________________________________________________________

 * Update end user documentation
   . Expand trouble shooting and bug reporting instructions.

 * Update documentation
   . Update Kyle's build documents at janusvm with new bundle details
     and commit to Tor VM svn.
   . Finish rest of this TODO file :)
   . Add in pending changes, chapters to design document.

   Update upstream package support in build infrastructure
   - Bypass OpenWRT MD5 package verification entirely with our own
     download process like the win32 build stage.
   ? OR(and?) Use Emdebian Crush and signature based verification
     initial testing indicates this should work without much hassle.
   ? OR(and?) Track upstream commits in a git repo and move to signed
     changesets of current and tested versions.
   . Integrate autotools / autoconf support so build scripts are less
     completely kludged together.

   Update build automation docs and hooks
   ? Add buildbot support into win32 ISO image so non-full builds are
     possible easily and requisite perl parts are present.

   Update Tor VM release packages
   ? Add support for run-as service configuration during install.
   ? Add support for SteadyState friendly configuration.
   ? Improve package removal to support real clean uninstall.
     (removing all installed directories and data, including cached
      package files and program data)

   Tor VM kernel networking improvements
   . Implement optional traffic shaping capabilities for client and
     server traffic.
   . Implement tarpit target default until Tor is successfully up and
     running to avoid cached failures and other annoying side effects
     of immediate RST.
   - Collaborate with ioerror on making the iptables rules in torwall
     compatible with Tor VM (and other implementations) to avoid
     duplication and oversights where possible.
   ? Implement ability to configure routes across multiple interfaces
     for power user or dynamic installations.

   Tor VM controller implementation clean up
   . Complete registry helpers for searching / cleaning registry
     entries created by tap and pcap devices.
   - Fix detection of default route when multiple gateways are present
     and route metric must be used to distinguish properly.
   ? Keep a host or guid identifier with the saved network state files
     to ensure that an unclean exit on one host does not accidentally
     hose the settings of another installation. (expect to use hostname
     and account name when considering saved state for load via netsh).

   Tor VM controller hardening
   - Provide at least minimal privilege separation for processes by
     user account.
   ? Integrate with SteadyState via registry backed configuration and
     provide deployment configuration scripts.
   ? Take advantage of fine grained authorization and permissions in
     Vista, Server 2008, and Windows 7.
   . Use CryptoAPI to gather entropy in host and pass to VM on command
     line for use in stronger seeding of first-run kernel random pool.

   General topics requiring further investigation and documentation
   ? Native 64bit apps and TAP device.
   ? Custom filtering and/or shaping by port and protocol.
   ? Multiple process model hardening.
   ? TorButton sans toggle in bundle.
   ? PortableFirefox in bundle.
   ? Multiple VM networking.
   ? Authenticated VM images.
